        Dear <span class="blurred">Agent 007</span> 
        <p>
            This is a confidential email. Please do not share with anyone.

        <p>
            We have an emergency. The secret formula for our <span class="blurred">Mega Marshmallow</span> has been compromised. This formula is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most delicious.
        </p>
        <p>
            We suspect that <span class="blurred">Professor Puff</span> is behind this. He has taken the formula to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is to infiltrate the lab and secure the formula before it's too late.
        </p>
        <p>This is a <span class="blurred">secret message</span>Be sure to keep the lab's location confidential. Any leak of this information could jeopardize the entire operation.</p>
